## Understanding the Game

The Word Context Game demonstrates how words derive meaning from context. Each question presents:
- A sentence containing an ambiguous word
- Four possible meanings for that word
- Only one meaning is correct in the specific context
- The other options are valid definitions of the word in different contexts

The goal is to help players (especially children ages 5-15 and language learners) develop contextual understanding of vocabulary.

## Question Structure

Each question in `questions.json` follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "sentence": "The bat flew around the cave.",
  "highlightedWord": "bat",
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "a",
      "text": "A flying mammal",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "explanation": "In this context, 'bat' refers to the nocturnal flying mammal that uses echolocation to navigate."
    },
    {
      "id": "b",
      "text": "A wooden stick for hitting balls",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "While 'bat' can refer to a sports implement, this meaning doesn't fit the context of flying in a cave."
    },
    {
      "id": "c",
      "text": "To hit or strike something",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "Although 'bat' can be used as a verb meaning to hit, the sentence structure uses it as a noun that performs the action of flying."
    },
    {
      "id": "d",
      "text": "To flutter one's eyelashes",
      "isCorrect": false,

      "text": "To measure the depth of water",
      "isCorrect": false,
